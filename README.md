Business Problem:
-	Loan Defaulting is one of the issues faced by many businesses.
-	The impacts can vary depending on how the loan defaulting is managed, but typically the businesses would incur losses that will present itself on their balance sheet, potentially causing more problems down the road.
-	As such, there is motivation for businesses to be able to predict who will default on loans, to reduce the consequences suffered.
-	To do so, businesses typically look at several factors, such as debt-to-income ratio and credit score of the borrower. However, the advent of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence can potentially improve such prediction capabilities.
Data:

How the chosen data can be used to solve your business problem:
-	The dataset contains past information on whether a certain loan has been defaulted on or not (Target column)
-	The dataset also contains information on the borrower of the said loan, such as their gender, number of children etc.
-	Supervised Machine Learning techniques can be done using the borrowerâ€™s details in order to predict whether the loan will be defaulted on or not.
